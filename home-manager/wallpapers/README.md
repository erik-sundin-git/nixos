# :handshake: Contributing
If possible, include the lossless version of the wallpaper such as an SVG. These can be used to produce new color variants or resolutions.

To keep the repo organized, please stick to the naming convention: `wallpaper-name_id_resolution.extension`. The `id` is for differentiating another wallpaper with the same name; it starts at `00`. Lossless formats such as an SVG should have `scalable` or `lossless` in the `resolution` field. Some examples:

```
windows_00_1920x1080.png
windows_01_1920x1080.png
peaceful-oasis_00_2560x1440.jpg
zebra-stripes_00_1280x720.png
zebra-stripes_00_scalable.svg
```

Thanks to all who contribute! :pray:
